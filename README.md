# MusicPlayer
Vanilla JavaScript Simple Music Player with fully functional progress bar, previous, play, and next buttons.

A simple Music Player website that I created myself to experiment with audio out of my curiosity.

The songs and images that I used are not mine and I do not claim them as mine, the copyright belongs to the original owners and creators of the content, I only used three songs and three images for this Music Player as a test, but feel free to test it out yourself and add as many songs and images that you want.
